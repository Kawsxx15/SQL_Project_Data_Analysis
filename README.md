📊 Data Analyst Job Market Analysis (2023)

1. Introduction

This project explores the 2023 Data Analyst job market using SQL to uncover insights about top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and optimal skill combinations.

The goal is to understand what skills drive higher salaries and which tools are most valuable for aspiring data analysts, especially for remote roles.

The analysis is fully SQL-driven and structured into multiple focused queries, each answering a specific business question.

2. Background

The data used in this project comes from a dataset of data-related job postings in 2023, including information about:

Job titles and roles

Salaries (yearly and hourly)

Job locations (remote vs onsite)

Required skills

Companies posting the jobs

As the data analytics field becomes increasingly competitive, understanding which skills are most demanded and best compensated is crucial for career planning and 
upskilling.

3. Tools I Have Used

This project was built using the following tools and technologies:

PostgreSQL – Core database used for querying and analysis

VS Code – Writing, organizing, and managing SQL files

Git & GitHub – Version control and project documentation

These tools together enabled efficient querying, experimentation, and reproducibility of the analysis.

4. The Analysis

The analysis is divided into five key SQL-driven sections, each represented by a separate SQL file:

1️⃣ Top Paying Jobs

Identified the highest-paying Data Analyst roles based on average yearly salary, with a focus on remote positions.

Key questions answered:

What are the top-paying Data Analyst jobs?

Which companies offer the highest salaries?

2️⃣ Top Skills Needed for Top Paying Jobs

Analyzed the skills associated with the highest-paying jobs to understand what employers expect at the top end of the market.

Key questions answered:

Which skills appear most often in high-paying roles?

What technical stack differentiates top salaries?

3️⃣ Most In-Demand Skills

Focused on skill demand across all job postings, regardless of salary, to identify core skills required in the market.

Key questions answered:

Which skills are most frequently requested?

What are the baseline skills for Data Analysts?

4️⃣ Top Skills Based on Salary

Combined salary data with skill data to determine which skills correlate with higher pay.

Key questions answered:

Which skills are associated with higher average salaries?

Are cloud and engineering skills financially valuable?

5️⃣ Optimal Skills to Learn

Synthesized demand + salary insights to identify the best skills to learn that balance:

High demand

High salary potential

This section provides actionable guidance for learning and career development.

5. What I Learned

Through this project, I significantly strengthened my SQL and data analysis skills, including:

CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for cleaner, modular queries

Subqueries for multi-step analytical logic

Advanced SQL concepts, such as:

CASE statements

UNION ALL

Aggregate functions with GROUP BY

Filtering with WHERE vs HAVING

JOIN strategies:

INNER JOIN vs LEFT JOIN

Many-to-many relationships using bridge tables

PostgreSQL-specific syntax and best practices

I also learned how to translate business questions into SQL queries and structure an analysis like a real-world data project.

6. Conclusions

The analysis shows that top-paying Data Analyst roles in 2023 require more than basic reporting skills.

🔑 Key takeaways:

SQL and Python are non-negotiable core skills

BI tools like Tableau and Power BI remain highly valuable

Cloud platforms (Snowflake, AWS, Azure) significantly increase salary potential

High-paying analysts often work close to data engineering and analytics engineering teams

Overall, this project highlights that combining strong analytical foundations with modern data stack skills is the most effective path to higher-paying Data 

Analyst roles.
